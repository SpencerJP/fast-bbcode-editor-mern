A live demo of this project is available at [Redux Servers](https://www.reduxservers.com/demo).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## BBCode Live Editor

This project is a full stack live bbcode (phpBB forum code) editor.
Also includes some discord OAuth2 for the non-demo portion that I am using it for.
It is built on a React/Redux frontend, Express.js backend, and a MongoDB database.
Testing is done in Jest, however there is not much code coverage yet.
