                    you're doing something wrong. <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">2.</span>
                    Freekilling/RDM/Teamkilling is not accepted. <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">3.</span>
                    Do not give intentional "freedays" under any circumstance (except for "first day freeday" after a
                    map change/extension). <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">4.</span> Do not intentionally
                    stall/delay the rounds (this includes Cell Days). Don't hide and wait for prolonged amounts of time
                    (Camping). Players deemed to be doing so will be teleported to another area. <br> <span
                        style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">5.</span> Warden must communicate appropriately, whether it
                    be by voice chat or through way points (C by default - Note: waypoints do not count as specific
                    orders; you must also indicate by voice the action you wish the prisoners to complete). If you don't
                    communicate, don't become the Warden. It is also not advised to become a warden if your microphone
                    is of poor quality or if you are hard to understand - all it does is make it a pain for the people
                    trying to listen to you and carry out your orders. <br><span
                        style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">6.</span> Guards must obey and protect the warden at
                    all-times; do what he says when he says it. <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">7.</span>
                    Prisoners and Guards may refuse an order that will lead to certain death (if you are ordered to jump
                    off a building or do anything that will endanger your life you are allowed to refuse the order).
                    <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">8.</span> Guards are not allowed to gunplant. Do not
                    bring and distribute weapons to prisoners under any circumstance. Failure to follow this rule will
                    result in a lengthy ban. <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">9.</span> Do not
                    Ghost/Metagame. If you are dead, do not give the prisoners who are still alive any information that
                    could affect the day. <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">10.</span> Guards cannot
                    interfere with a prisoner's Last Request. If they are having a battle do not shoot the prisoner.
                    However, if the prisoner is specifically targeting guards other than their chosen LR opponent, this
                    counts as rebelling and the prisoner can be kos. <br><span
                        style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">11.</span> Kill prisoners within reason; if they have a knife
                    do not just gun them down, you must ask them to drop it first. If they have a gun, even if it is
                    holstered, you may kill them (LR is excepted). <br><span
                        style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">12.</span> You are not allowed to camp the armory. After you
                    have chosen your weaponry you should leave it. <br><span
                        style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">13.</span> Do not close cells once they have been opened
                    unless prisoners are to enter them later in the day. <br><span
                        style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">14.</span> If the Warden has not given an order before 60
                    seconds after the start of a round then it is a free day. <br><span
                        style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">15.</span> You cannot prevent users from doing Last Request,
                    and neither player can use the medic bay or health kits during Last Request. <br><span
                        style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">16.</span> All Guards must communicate clearly with working
                    microphones (an exception to this is when there are not enough players who wish to fill open guard
                    spots). All guards must have the intention of becoming the Warden. Refer to rule no. 5. <br> <span
                        style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">17.</span> When a KOS order has been made any new,
                    conflicting orders will override it (unless playing Simon Says. This also excludes games such as
                    Lava day, War day, or any other day, use your common sense and realize when you are using cheap
                    tricks to kill off players, refer to rule no 1. (For example, Warden: Leaving Circle is KOS, (1
                    minute later) Warden: All prisoners to the square. once they leave the circle to go to the square
                    you cannot KOS them for leaving). <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">18.</span> If you're
                    the last guard alive you may KOS anyone that is holding a weapon. You may also try to take position
                    of warden by giving new orders to the prisoners - if they do not comply they are rebelling (KOS).
                    <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">19.</span> No baiting prisoners as a guard, meaning you
                    can't move into their fist range on purpose or jump on their heads. Avoid moving near them because
                    if they do punch you, they are fine to do so as you moved within their radius rather than them
                    charging at you. If prisoners are ordered to be AFK frozen they may not punch but the admins will
                    punish those who baited them. <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">20.</span> We aren't here
                    to simply win rounds but to allow both teams to have fun, don't make killing everyone your main goal
                    but make your goal giving everyone a chance to contribute and survive. This rule applies to both the
                    guard team and the prisoner team. Furthermore, days which can be considered cruel to prisoners (eg.
                    faze clan recruitment) are prohibited. <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">21.</span> No
                    prop surfing or killing. <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">22.</span> Do not repeat
                    days/games (E.G: Three war days in a row) <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">23.</span> No
                    cell days; prisoners must be out of their cells by 1 and a half minutes (1.30) after the beginning
                    of the round. <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">24.</span> Games/days that require the
                    use of the developer console are prohibited. <br><span style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">25.</span>
                    As a guard, do not open the cell doors without your warden's permission. <br><span
                        style="color: rgb(191, 255, 255);">26.</span> First-Day-Special-Days which involve prisoners
                    spawning with a weapon are to be played like a war day. Any other First-Day-Special-Days will
                    continue to be considered First Day Freeday. <br><br> <em>Rules are subject to change...</em>
